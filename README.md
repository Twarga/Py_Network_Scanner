# Network Scanner

## Introduction

Welcome to the Network Scanner project! This Python application serves as a network port scanner with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) implemented using the Tkinter library. The main goal is to provide users with a versatile tool for scanning networks, enabling them to specify a target IP address or range of IP addresses and define the ports to be scanned.

## Setup the Environment

### To Run the Script

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that Python and Pip are installed.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

     ```bash
     pip install python-nmap
     ```

2. **Navigate to Project Folder:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Change directory to the project folder containing the script:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/project/folder
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the following command to run the network scanner:

     ```bash
     python your_script.py
     ```

     Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python script.

### To Build the Executable

#### On Windows
